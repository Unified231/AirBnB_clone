# AirBnB_clone project 
 Background Context The objective of this project is to develop an AirBnB clone by creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This initial step is crucial as it sets the foundation for subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development. Each task in this project is interconnected and will contribute to the broader goal of building a functional AirBnB clone. By the end, we'll have gained valuable experience in various aspects of web development.

Learning Objectives By the end of this project, we will be proficient in the following concepts and skills:

Creating a Python package Developing a command interpreter using the cmd module Implementing unit testing in a large project Serializing and deserializing a class Reading and writing JSON files Managing datetime and UUID Utilizing *args and **kwargs Handling named arguments in functions
